
   **** PSEUDO ELEMENT ****

   CSS pseudo-elements are used to add special effects to some selectors. You do 
not need to use JavaScript or any other script to use those effects. A simple 
syntax of pseudo-element is as follows:
selector:pseudo-element {property: value}
CSS classes can also be used with the pseudo-elements:
selector.class:pseudo-element {property: value}
The most commonly used pseudo-elements are as follows:
Value Description
:first-line Use this element to add special styles to the first line of the text 
in a selector.
:first-letter Use this element to add special style to the first letter of the text 
in a selector.
:before Use this element to insert some content before an element.
:after Use this element to insert some content after an element.
